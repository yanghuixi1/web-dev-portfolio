          <p>
            I'm moved to bring data to life - taking it from an initial scrape
            to a robust model, with a special focus on sequence data: natural
            language and time series. I have abundant experience in generating
            primary data as well as aggregating secondary data from disparate
            sources and translating it into value for the organizations that
            I've been a part of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I've had the fortune of working in several
            countries and collaborating with diverse teams that have shaped my
            ability to adapt and thrive quickly in new environments. As a
            researcher I uncover the gears that drive complex systems and as a
            teacher I distill them into practical understanding from which
            concrete action steps can be taken. Now I seek to leverage what I've
            built to tackle more challenging problems and produce greater impact
            through my work in future-minded organizations that put data at the
            forefront of their product and processes.
